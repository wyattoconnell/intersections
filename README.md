Intersections

A completely original daily puzzle game created using Angular and deployed on Hostinger.

*This project is still in progress* Like many others, I habitually participate in the NYT word games each morning. I wanted to create my own variation that mimicked the aesthetics and satisfying animations that make games like connections and wordle so addicting. I still need to implement local storage, instructions, scaling for mobile, and end-game behavior.
